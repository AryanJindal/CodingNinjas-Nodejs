# network protocol stack

- going to see what happens inside the network pipelines
- `Internet` ==> network of networks
- `Intranet` ==> private internet

- There are two major models
  - `OSI`
    - 7 layers
      - **Application**
        - End user uses it
        - Emailing
        - chatting
      - **presentation**
        - Set up on end devices
        - Presentation
          - Retrives data from the sender
          - displays the data to the reciever
        - Compression
        - Encryption
      - **session**
        - User session management
      - **transport**
        - Most important
        - Divides big chunk of data into packets
        - Manages these chunks
        - Whether loss of packets is allowed or not
      - **network**
        - HOw routing of packets will be done on the network.
      - **data link**
        - Error/Flow Control
        - Multiplexxing
        - Demultiplexing
        - handles address
      - physical layer
        - comes through wires/waves
  - `TCP/Ip`
    - 5 layers
      - `Layer 1(Application)` ==> (Appliation + presentation+ session)
      - presentation layer
      - session layer
      - transport layer
      - network layer
      - data link layer
      - physical layer
- Basically both are same but just dirtibution part is different
- Sets different department of what should happen where
- Generally TCP/IP is used
